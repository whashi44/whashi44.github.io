# Bachelors degree: Applied Physics 
I graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Physics from Northern Illinois University (Illinois, USA) in 2018. In the beginning, I was interested in teaching physics because I was good at presenting physics information in an approachable manner. Then I started diving into the field of physics education to learn more about improving teaching physics. This research was fun! Collecting student's demographic information, test score, and survey results to understand the patter greatly trained my critical thinking skill. Presenting those results helped me how to convey information to the general audience at the same time engaging the audience to prevent them from dosing off during my presentation. On top of that, learning how to teach physics also emphasized my ability to learn physics, which helped to improve my grades. The theoretical part of physics was difficult to grasp the concept, but when I visualize and apply the concept in my head to be able to explain it to other classmates, I was able to understand the concept even further. Because of this experience, I discovered that I enjoy the application part of physics, and switched my emphasis from teaching to applied physics, and continued with Masters in Mechanical Engineering. 

# Masters degree: Mechanical Engineering
Navigating through Mechanical Engineering was challenging but exciting. Engineering put great emphasis on software knowledge, and I was exposed to Matlab, ANSYS, Solidworks, Linux, and python. After automating many daily tasks for my engineering research, I fell in love with python. After learning Python, I thought back to myself "If I could use python for my previous data analysis instead of the Excel, my life would have been a lot better."
